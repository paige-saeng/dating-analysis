"Timestamp","How old are you?","Where are you on the spectrum of non-serious to serious dating style? I understand we can go through multiple phases of dating styles in our lives, but try to choose a number that best describes your dating style history. How do you usually approach dating? 

1. free spirit
- I typically do not search for any form of commitment 
- I date in search of pleasure and fun 
- I do not want a relationship
- possible examples: one-night stands, flings, a bae for the night 
2. the only feelings i want to feel is an orgasm 
- AKA “friends with benefits”
- I typically have relationships with people that can involve casual sex, non-exclusivity, fun and pleasure
- not a romantic relationship, more of a sexual relationship 
3. here for a good time, and if i like you enough, maybe for a long time (not really that long usually)
- AKA “situation-ships”
- I typically have relationships with people that can involve casual sex, connection, fun and pleasure
- can mimic emotional vulnerability of a monogamous relationship, without the monogamy
4. go-er with the flow-er
- CAN be a mix of 3 and 5 dating style
- not necessarily searching for a relationship or situation-ship
- hence the name, I go with the flow 
5. maybe they're the one! or at least one of the ones!
- I am typically a relationship person, but I date mostly for fun (short or long term relationships)
- romantic and/or sexual relationship
- possible reasons: young, able to be monogamous but not thinking about marriage, want to avoid STDs by having one sexual partner at a time (however, the terms of exclusivity is subjective to each relationship)
- this also includes serial daters: person who jumps from one relationship to another 
6. cohabiter
- I date to date and then after a period of time, I will consider marriage
- cohabitation: a long-term relationship, can be living together, have sexual and/or romantic relationship, but NOT married
- common amongst young people as well
7. 4lifer. i don't want anyone else, but you!
- dating to marry
- I am only going to date someone if I think I will eventually marry them 
- when I date someone, I think about my future with them and I think my s/o will potentially be my partner/husband/wife
- a deal breaker if I do not see a future with them","Approximate how many people you have explored a connection with TOTAL (failed and successful)
- situationships
- people you have been on dates with/have dated 
- friends with benefits
- people you met on Hinge, Bumble, possibly Tinder for some circumstances
- not necessarily asking if physical intimacy was explored with said person 
- in general, anyone you have tried pursuing ","How many of those explored connections were meaningful?"
